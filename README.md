## ü§î Reflection

This project was part of a class assignment learning Angular. It was set out to see various things we can do with Angular on a website. It was my first time coding a project using Angular.js. 

I would like to build on this and create and adjust the functionalities that are built in to make this application into something more professional and polished.
